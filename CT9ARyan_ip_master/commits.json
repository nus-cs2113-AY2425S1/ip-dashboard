This helped to remove the redundant else block, making the if block a lot neater and easier to read. Secondly, my initial iteration of the code encountered an issue of deep nesting, aka the arrowhead style code, and this was the biggest (visual) flaw in my code. By refactoring my code, I managed to extract the contents in the large if block into 2 separate methods. This resulted in a short, concise and neat code which is still easy to understand and read. Lastly, I also refactored the \"magic numbers\" as constants, declared at the top of the code. This gives meaning to these arbituary values that I used and helps other readers make sense of them when they read through my code. Next, I also added exception handling functionalities for both the \"deadline\" and \"event\" commands in the event that the user enters an incorrect command format. Lastly, I created a method to print out the default exception message.\n","tags":["A-CodeQuality"],"fileTypesAndContributionMap":{"java":{"insertions":77,"deletions":40}}},{"hash":"a3e9f31cfea955c7183743909cb558b994f600b4","isMergeCommit":false,"messageTitle":"Use TextUI testing to semi automate the testing process and check for potential regressions","messageBody":"Using the input/output redirection technique, the input.txt stores all the input that are to be fed to the program/source code, and the output will be stored in another txt file called \"ACTUAL.txt\". The latter is then compared with EXPECTED.txt - a file containing the expected output of the code, given the inputs defined in the input.txt file, and any difference in the files will be displayed in the terminal.\n\nInitially, even after following all the steps correctly and ensuring that the contents in both EXPECTED.txt and ACTUAL.txt LOOK exactly the same, the file compare (FC) command still showed a difference in the 2 files. To resolve this, I had to open these 2 files in my Notepad++ app and highlight all the contents of the file. Narrowing down my search to the lines where the errors were reported, this was when i realised that the difference was actually empty space characters, which cannot be seen by the naked eye. Following that, I went back to my code to make the necessary changes, and now the files are identical!\n\nIn summary, this exercise taught me how to semi automate the testing of textUIs using the I/O redirection technique. This tool/skill proved to be effective as it helps to check for potential bugs/regressions whenever we made changes to the code, and this makes the whole testing process easier, instead of having to manually write the test cases.\n","tags":["A-TextUiTesting"],"fileTypesAndContributionMap":{"txt":{"insertions":22,"deletions":0}}}]},{"date":"2024-09-07","commitResults":[{"hash":"9dd263e88d0c8872ecc0b025ab350f9aa89c343c","isMergeCommit":false,"messageTitle":"Minor bug fix in if else block for \"list\" command","messageBody":"The use of the return keyword in the if block exits the whole outer while loop, leading to the termination of the program when the list is empty (i.e when Task.getTaskCount() \u003d\u003d 0).

For the exception handling, a \"try-catch\" block, together with the \"throw\" keyword is implemented for every command block in Atom, so that every command block can throw and catch the corresponding exception depending on the user input. Multiple catch blocks are used if the exception handler in the command block needs to catch and handle different types of exception.\n\nFurthermore, to improve on code readability, I refactored the code by extracting 3 different methods from the if-else command blocks in the main method, namely \"addTodoTask\", \"addDeadlineTask\", and \"addEventTask\". This makes the main part of the code easier to read, understand, manage and it also looks more visually pleasing. I also refactored the size of the task list from \"100\" to \"MAX_NUMBER_OF_TASKS\" so as to avoid using magic numbers.\n","fileTypesAndContributionMap":{"java":{"insertions":104,"deletions":51}}},{"hash":"77d90834e1c48192b9f9b2cffeb999f4248b28ca","isMergeCommit":true,"messageTitle":"Merge branch \u0027branch-Level-5\u0027","messageBody":"","tags":["Level-5"],"fileTypesAndContributionMap":{}},{"hash":"931925f1399d28e93db0da2b32b43dd87dae8649","isMergeCommit":false,"messageTitle":"Organise classes into packages","messageBody":"Created 3 new packages.\n\n1. \"atom\" --\u003e main package/folder storing all the classes and packages related to Atom\n2. \"exception\" --\u003e stores all of Atom\u0027s custom exception classes\n3. \"task\" --\u003e stores all the task related classes (i.e Task, Todo, Deadline, Event)\n\nFollowing that, the package statment is included at the top of every source file.

In addition, in the main Atom source code, all the classes residing in the other packages need to be imported so that they can be used in the main Atom source code.
