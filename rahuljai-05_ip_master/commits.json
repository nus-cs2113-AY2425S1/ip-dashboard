support for ToDo, Deadline, and Event task types and refactor using inheritance to improve code quality","messageBody":"- Introduced three new task types: ToDo, Deadline, and Event.\n  - ToDo: Tracks tasks without a specific date or time.\n  - Deadline: Tracks tasks that need to be completed by a certain date.\n  - Event: Tracks tasks that span a start and end date or time.\n  - Enhanced the `list` command to display tasks with the appropriate type labels and deadlines.\n- Refactored task structure using inheritance:\n  - Created a base `Task` class to encapsulate common behavior for all task types (e.g., `markAsDone`, `unmarkAsDone`, and status tracking).\n  - `ToDo`, `Deadline`, and `Event` classes inherit from `Task`, reusing common functionality and reducing code duplication.\n  - Enhanced the `Deadline` and `Event` classes to handle date and time-specific functionality, while leveraging shared behavior from `Task`.\n- Improved code quality:\n  - Modularized input processing logic into helper methods (new `markAsDone`, `unmarkAsDone`, and `processTasks` methods).\n  - Enhanced error handling to provide clear feedback for invalid user input.\n","tags":["Level-4","A-CodeQuality"],"fileTypesAndContributionMap":{"java":{"insertions":149,"deletions":36}}}]},{"date":"2024-09-13","commitResults":[{"hash":"09d575b630ae91236662b454ac66009db098bbd8","isMergeCommit":false,"messageTitle":"Handle errors","messageBody":"Added support to handle the following errors:\n- No task provided for addition (throws error in case of deadline and event types as\n  you cannot split a null task string to get the deadlines - split error)\n- Task input format is erroneous (not enough /\u0027s in the case of deadline and event task types -\n  array index out of bounds error when you try to access the \u0027deadlines\u0027)\n\nAdded support to respond with corresponding warning messages\nfor the following invalid input cases:\n- Invalid command\n- Empty task name field (in the case of deadline and
