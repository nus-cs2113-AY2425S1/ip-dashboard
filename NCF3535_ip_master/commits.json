organization and allow for future

listing limited the chatbot\u0027s usefulness\nas it couldn\u0027t track or manage user tasks\n\nChanges made:\n* Store user commands as tasks in a fixed-size array, allowing them to\n  be listed later\n* Introduce a \"list\" command to display all stored tasks with their\n  indices\n* Update the program to exit on \"bye\" instead of \"exit\" to make it feel\n  more conversational and natural for users\n* Refactor output handling into the Display class to separate concerns\n  and maintain clean code\n\nThese changes improve the utility of Aether by enabling task management\nand making interactions more intuitive and
